The team includes two additional persons: Emilio de A. Calvet and Yuri R. Ribeiro, in addition to the presenter AntÃ´nio L. The main objective of our presentation was to elucidate the detailed criteria that guided the choice of MongoDB and NoSQL for our application. We deeply explored how these technologies efficiently handle large volumes of educational data, a crucial challenge faced by NERDS. Furthermore, we highlighted how our differentiated approach enables scalability and flexibility in the storage and manipulation of this data, always aiming to optimize performance and information security. The active participation of our team, composed of experienced and dedicated professionals, reinforces our commitment to innovation and excellence in the field of educational technology."

            "text": "The MongoDB Workshop held on November 17, 2023, as part of the NERDS Extension Project at UFC Russas, was a significant event. With over 30 participants, the workshop provided a comprehensive and practical introduction to MongoDB, one of today's most popular NoSQL database systems.\n\nThroughout the workshop, participants delved into the logic and practice of NoSQL, starting from basic fundamentals and progressing to advanced techniques. Essential concepts such as modeling unstructured data, schema flexibility, and the differences between MongoDB and traditional relational database systems were explored.\n\nA highlight was the detailed exploration of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations within MongoDB, empowering students to efficiently and scalably handle data. Additionally, advanced MongoDB features including indexing, aggregations, and file systems were covered, providing participants with a robust understanding of MongoDB's capabilities for real-world applications.\n\nThe instructional materials used during the workshop included practical examples and exercises that reinforced theoretical learning. Participants were able to immediately apply their new knowledge in practical projects, solidifying their understanding and preparing them to tackle challenges in developing modern, NoSQL-based applications.\n\nThis workshop not only expanded participants' horizons in the field of NoSQL databases but also strengthened collaboration and the spirit of learning within the academic community at UFC Russas. With positive feedback from students and growing interest in future editions, the MongoDB Workshop has established itself as an impactful educational initiative on campus."
